# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the green "Code" button at the top right of the page.

**2)** Extract the contents of **PeachHUD-Release.zip** into your **custom** folder (...\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom).   
Can't find your **Steam** folder? Right-click Team Fortress 2 in your Steam library and select **Manage** > **Browse local files**.

**3)** For 4:3, 5:4, or 16:10 aspect ratios, drag and replace the files inside **customizations/Aspect Ratio Overrides** to **resource/ui**.

**Note:** PeachHUD was developed for Windows computers, Linux is *mostly* supported and Mac is theoritcally supported but untested.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
PeachHUD enables easy customization of certain aspects of the HUD through the **customizations** folder. These customization options are planned to be expanded upon as I recieve suggestions or think of more possibilities. Customization presets are also a planned feature of PeachHUD for later down the road.

All the customizations can be found inside the **customizations** folder and to enable them you will need to do:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply (I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) for this).

**2)** Remove the `//` before `#base` from the line you **WANT** to apply and ensure all other lines have `//` before them.  
Some customization options require extra steps to enable, those steps are detailed in their respective file.

**3)** Save the file(s) and reload your HUD or restart TF2.
