# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the ![Download](https://i.imgur.com/ndWvgDK.png) button above and to the right of this.

**2)** Extract/Unzip the HUD

**3)** Copy the **peachhud** folder (**NOT** peachhud-Release, the one inside it!)

**4)** Paste the folder to your custom tf folder (...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**  
While PeachHUD inherited minmode support from SunsetHUD, development has basically neglected minmode for the time being, because of this I recommend keeping minmode **disabled**.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
Easily accessible customization is a planned feature of PeachHUD. Currently there are some customization options, though they may not be fully functional at this time.

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Inside the file uncomment the line of the customization you want to apply by removing the `//` before the `#base`
