# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the ![Download](https://i.imgur.com/EjYd8I5.png) button at the top right of the page

**2)** Extract/Unzip the HUD file

**3)** Copy the **peachhud** folder (**NOT** peachhud-Release, the one inside it!)

**4)** Paste the folder to your custom tf folder (...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**  
While PeachHUD inherited minmode support from SunsetHUD, development has basically neglected minmode for the time being, because of this I recommend keeping minmode **disabled**.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
Easily accessible customization is a planned feature of PeachHUD. Currently there are some customization options, though they may not be fully functional at this time.

All the customizations can be found inside the **customizations** folder and to enable them you will need to do:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Inside the file uncomment the line of the customization you want to apply by removing the `//` before the `#base`
