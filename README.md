# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the ![Download](https://i.imgur.com/EjYd8I5.png) button at the top right of the page

**2)** Extract/Unzip the HUD file

**3)** Copy the **peachhud** folder (**NOT** peachhud-Release, the one inside it!)

**4)** Paste the folder to your custom tf folder (...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**  
While PeachHUD inherited minmode support from SunsetHUD, development has basically neglected minmode for the time being, because of this I recommend keeping minmode **disabled**.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
PeachHUD enables easy customization of certain aspects of the HUD through the **customizations** folder. These customization options are planned to be expanded upon as I recieve suggestions or think of more possibilities. Customization presets are also a planned feature of PeachHUD for later down the road.

All the customizations can be found inside the **customizations** folder and to enable them you will need to do:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Inside the file, uncomment **ONLY** the line of the customization you want to apply by removing the `//` before `#base`

**3)** Some customization options require extra steps to enable, those steps are detailed in their respective file
