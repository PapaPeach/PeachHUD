# INSTALLATION
**1)** Extract/Unzip the HUD

**2)** Copy the * *peachhud* *  folder (**NOT** peachhud-Release, the one inside it!)

**3)** Paste the folder to your custom tf folder (...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**  
If you are using a 4:3 or 16:10 aspect ration replace the all the files you find inside the "4x3 & 16x10 Overrides" folder over the normal hud files. **This is a totally untested feature, I don't reccomend using it**"
 
# CUSTIOMIZATION
Easily accessible HUD customization is a planned feature of PeachHUD. Currently there are some customization options, though they may not be fully functional at this time.

All the customizations can be found inside the Customizations folder and from there all you need to do is:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Inside the file uncomment the line of the customization you want to apply by removing the `//` before the `#base`
