# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the ![Download](https://i.imgur.com/EjYd8I5.png) button at the top right of the page

**2)** Extract/Unzip the HUD file

**3)** Copy the **peachhud** folder (**NOT** peachhud-Release, the one inside it!)

**4)** Paste the folder to your custom tf folder (...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**  
While PeachHUD inherited minmode support from SunsetHUD, development has basically neglected minmode for the time being, because of this I recommend keeping minmode **disabled**.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
Easily accessible customization is a planned feature of PeachHUD. Currently there are some customization options, though they may not recieve as much testing from me as the main aspects of the HUD. As of right now Damage and Scoreboard customization is **NOT** Supported. 

All the customizations can be found inside the **customizations** folder and to enable them you will need to do:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Inside the file uncomment the line of the customization you want to apply by removing the `//` before the `#base`

**3)** Some customization options require extra steps to be enabled, those steps are detailed in their respective file
