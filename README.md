# INSTALLATION
**1)** Download the HUD by clicking the ![Download](https://i.imgur.com/EjYd8I5.png) button at the top right of the page

**2)** Open the downloaded **PeachHUD-Release.zip** folder and the **PeachHUD-Release** folder inside of that

**3)** Copy the **peachhud** folder (**NOT** **PeachHUD-Release**, the one inside it!)

**4)** Paste it into your **custom** folder (...\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)  
**Tip:** Can't find your **Steam** folder? Right-click Team Fortress 2 in your Steam library and select **Manage > Browse local files**

**5)** For 4:3 or 16:10 aspect ratios, drag and replace the files inside **customizations/4x3 & 16x10 Overrides** to **resource/ui**

**NOTES:**  
While PeachHUD inherited minmode support from SunsetHUD, development has basically neglected minmode for the time being. Because of this, upon loading PeachHUD for the first time **minmode will be automatically disabled**, I recommend keeping it this way.

# CUSTIOMIZATION
PeachHUD enables easy customization of certain aspects of the HUD through the **customizations** folder. These customization options are planned to be expanded upon as I recieve suggestions or think of more possibilities. Customization presets are also a planned feature of PeachHUD for later down the road.

All the customizations can be found inside the **customizations** folder and to enable them you will need to do:

**1)** Open the customization file you would like to apply

**2)** Remove the `//` before `#base` from the line you **WANT** to apply and ensure all other lines have `//` before them  
**Tip:** Some customization options require extra steps to enable, those steps are detailed in their respective file

**3)** Save the file(s) and reload your HUD or restart TF2
